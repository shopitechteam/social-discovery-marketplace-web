/**
 * Location landing pages for car sellers.
 *
 * "Sell my car in Nairobi" is a materially different query from "sell my car in
 * Kenya", and the national hub at /sell-car-kenya cannot rank for both. Car
 * selling is also the most location-bound category on the marketplace: a buyer
 * will drive across a county to inspect a car, but almost never across the
 * country, so the town genuinely changes who sees the listing and what they pay.
 *
 * Each page has to earn its ranking. A template with the town name swapped in
 * is a doorway page and gets filtered, so every entry here carries facts that
 * are only true of that town — which models actually move there, who the buyers
 * are, where viewings happen, and where the nearest NTSA office is. Where a
 * claim would be the same everywhere, it lives on the national hub instead.
 *
 * Deliberately no price figures. A stale number destroys trust with the exact
 * person we are trying to convert, and live listings answer the question better
 * than a hardcoded range could.

      "Nairobi is the deepest car market in Kenya and the one where a good listing sells fastest. It is also the most competitive, so presentation and an honest price decide whether buyers message you or scroll past.",
    marketNotes:
      "More cars change hands in Nairobi than anywhere else in the country, which cuts both ways. Buyers are plentiful and many can view the same week, but they are also comparing your car against dozens of similar listings before they message anyone. Nairobi buyers are the most likely in Kenya to bring their own mechanic, to ask for the logbook before viewing, and to walk away over a vague answer about accident history. They are also the least tolerant of a price set above the visible market, because the comparison is one search away.",

      "The coast is a smaller market than Nairobi but a distinctive one. Sea air means corrosion is the first thing an experienced Mombasa buyer checks, and a car that has spent its life upcountry can actually command a premium here for exactly that reason — say so if it applies to yours.

That makes the audience larger than the town's size suggests, but it also means first viewings need to be worth a journey — a listing with a walkaround video converts noticeably better here than a photo-only one.

Buyers here are largely Nairobi commuters, so demand looks like Nairobi demand: economical saloons and small SUVs, bought for a daily run into the city. The practical advantage over listing in Nairobi itself is that viewings are easier to arrange, since a buyer in Ruiru or Juja can meet you without crossing the city.
