 * The "leave this screen" control on the auth pages.
 *
 * It used to be a Home link pointing at `/`. That made no sense for the way
 * people actually reach auth: the guard sends them here mid-session from the
 * feed, a profile, a listing — and the escape hatch answered by throwing them
 * out to the marketing page, somewhere they had already left.
 *
 * Going back is the honest action, and history gives it for free: whether they
 * came from the feed or from the landing page, back returns them there. The
 * fallback only matters for someone who opened an auth URL directly, and it
 * prefers `from` — the page the guard recorded before redirecting — over a
 * guess.
