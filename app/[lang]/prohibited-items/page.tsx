          <p>
            Shopi connects buyers and sellers, but that doesn&apos;t mean anything can be listed. This policy sets out what you cannot post, sell, or promote on Shopi. It&apos;s based on Kenyan law and general marketplace safety standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Listing a prohibited item may result in content removal and account suspension or termination. Some violations may also be reported to law enforcement.
          </p>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Absolutely Prohibited">
          <p>The following can never be listed on Shopi, regardless of licensing or intent:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Illegal drugs and controlled substances</strong> — narcotics, psychotropic substances, and drug paraphernalia intended for illegal drug use</li>
            <li><strong>Weapons</strong> — firearms, ammunition, explosives, and weapons whose sale is restricted or banned under Kenyan law (e.g. the Firearms Act)</li>
            <li><strong>Counterfeit goods</strong> — fake or unauthorised replicas of branded products</li>
            <li><strong>Stolen property</strong> — any item you don&apos;t have the legal right to sell</li>
            <li><strong>Human remains or body parts</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Wildlife and endangered species products</strong> — ivory, bushmeat, or any item prohibited under the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act</li>
            <li><strong>Dangerous chemicals and hazardous materials</strong> — substances that pose a safety risk if mishandled, including unlicensed pesticides and industrial chemicals</li>
            <li><strong>Fraudulent documents</strong> — fake IDs, forged certificates, counterfeit currency, or academic credentials</li>
            <li><strong>Financial scams and pyramid/Ponzi schemes</strong> — including &quot;quick money&quot; investment schemes and unregistered multi-level marketing that relies on recruitment rather than product sales</li>
            <li><strong>Recalled products</strong> — items officially recalled for safety reasons</li>
            <li><strong>Content sexually exploiting minors</strong> — reported immediately to relevant authorities</li>
          </ul>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Restricted — Allowed Only With Conditions">
          <p>Some categories are not banned outright but come with restrictions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Prescription medicines:</strong> Cannot be sold by unlicensed individuals. Only listable by licensed pharmacies or medical suppliers who comply with the Pharmacy and Poisons Board&apos;s requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Alcohol and tobacco products:</strong> Sellers must comply with Kenyan licensing requirements and age-verification obligations; listings must not target minors.</li>
            <li><strong>Live animals:</strong> Must comply with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and any relevant transport/welfare regulations. No listing of animals obtained illegally or through poaching.</li>
            <li><strong>Adult content and services:</strong> Sexual services and pornographic content are not permitted on Shopi.</li>
          </ul>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Why We Restrict These Categories">
          <p>
            Kenyan law regulates many of these categories directly, and some can cause real harm if traded without proper oversight. Where a category is restricted rather than banned, sellers are responsible for holding any required licences and following the applicable law — Shopi does not verify licences before a listing goes live, so buyers should always ask a seller for proof where it matters (for example, with medicines).
          </p>

        <LegalSection title="Reporting a Prohibited Listing">
          <p>
            If you see a listing you believe violates this policy, please report it — see our <Link href={`${base}/contact`}>Contact Us</Link> page or use the in-app reporting tools where available. We review reports and remove violating content.
          </p>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="Changes to This Policy">
          <p>
            We may update this list as Kenyan law changes or as we learn more about how the platform is used. Check back periodically for updates.
