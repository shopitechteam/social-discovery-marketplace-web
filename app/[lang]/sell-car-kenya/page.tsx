Buyers message you on Shopi, you arrange inspection, and you complete ownership transfer through the NTSA TIMS portal.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much is my car worth in Kenya?",
    a: "The most reliable guide is what comparable cars are being advertised for right now — same make, model, year, grade and mileage. Condition, accident history, logbook status and service records move the figure more than mileage alone. Price inside the range for a fast sale, at the top of it if you can wait.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I sell my car without a broker in Kenya?",
    a: "Yes. Brokers take a commission or add a markup, and they sit between you and the buyer. Listing directly on Shopi is free, buyers message you themselves, and you keep the full sale price. The trade-off is that you handle viewings and the NTSA transfer yourself.",
  },
  {
    q: "What documents do I need to sell a car in Kenya?",
    a: "The logbook in your name with no outstanding financing, your national ID and KRA PIN, an active NTSA TIMS account, and a signed sale agreement. At transfer you also need copies of the buyer's ID and KRA PIN. Confirm current requirements on the NTSA TIMS portal, since fees and steps change.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast can I sell my car in Kenya?",
    a: "Presentation and price decide it. A listing with a walkaround video, honest photos including any wear, a clear asking price and a stated logbook status gets more genuine enquiries and far fewer time-wasters than a two-photo listing with no price.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I sell a car on Shopi in Kenya?",
    a: "Yes. You can post a car for sale on Shopi with photos or video, price, location, make, model, condition and other important details, then interested buyers message you directly.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Shopi charge commission when I sell my car?",
    a: "No. Shopi does not take commission or process payment. You and the buyer negotiate and complete the sale directly.",
  },

    a: "Include clear photos or video, make, model, year, mileage, price in Kenyan Shillings, location, ownership documents status, service history and any known issues.",

    q: "How do I avoid unsafe car deals?",
    a: "Meet in a public place, verify documents, avoid sending money before inspection, and complete ownership transfer through the proper official process.",
