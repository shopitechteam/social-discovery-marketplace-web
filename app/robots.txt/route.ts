 * robots.txt as a route handler rather than Next's `robots.ts` metadata file.
 *
 * The metadata API can only emit User-agent/Allow/Disallow/Sitemap. We also
 * want comment lines pointing crawlers at /llms.txt, and explicit per-bot
 * groups for the AI crawlers — neither of which that API can express. Emitting
 * the file directly is the only way to say both.
 *
 * On the explicit AI-bot groups: a bare `User-agent: *` already allows them, so
 * these change nothing functionally today. They are here so the intent is
 * recorded — anyone later tightening the wildcard group has to make a
 * deliberate decision about AI crawlers rather than cutting off generative
 * search by accident, which is the most common way sites lose GEO visibility.
