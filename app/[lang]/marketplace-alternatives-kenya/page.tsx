const COMPARISONS = [
  {
    channel: "Classifieds marketplaces",
    how: "You search a category tree, filter, and contact sellers through the platform. Discovery is driven by what you already know to look for.",
    shopi:
      "Shopi leads with a feed instead of a search box. You come across things you weren't searching for, ranked by what's near you and what you've shown interest in — and you can still search when you know exactly what you want.",
  },
  {
    channel: "Facebook Marketplace and buy/sell groups",
    how: "Discovery is social and local, but listings sit inside a general-purpose social network alongside everything else, and structure varies wildly between posts.",
    shopi:
      "Shopi is only a marketplace, so every post carries a price, a location, a category and a way to message the seller. Nothing competes with the listing for attention.",
  },
  {
    channel: "WhatsApp and Telegram selling groups",
    how: "Fast and trusted within the group, but items scroll away, there is no search, and reach stops at the group's membership.",
    shopi:
      "A Shopi listing stays live, is searchable, and reaches buyers beyond anyone you already know — while the conversation still happens in chat, the way it does in a group.",
  },
  {
    channel: "TikTok and Instagram selling",
    how: "Excellent for reach and for showing an item in motion, but the platforms aren't built to carry a price, a location or a listing that a buyer can find again next week.",
    shopi:
      "Shopi keeps the video-first format and adds the marketplace layer underneath it — price, location, seller profile and direct messaging. You can also share a Shopi post straight to TikTok.",
  },
];

const DIFFERENCES = [
  {
    title: "No commission, ever",
    body: "Shopi does not take a percentage of your sale. It has no checkout and never holds your money, so there is nothing to deduct — you agree a price with the buyer and that is what you receive.",
  },
  {
    title: "The deal stays between two people",
    body: "No cart, no escrow, no Shopi agent in the middle. Buyer and seller settle price, payment method and pickup or delivery directly.",
  },
  {
    title: "AI does the typing",
    body: "Shopi Agent turns a photo into a full listing and finds products from a plain-language description, so posting doesn't mean filling a long form.",
  },
  {
    title: "Local first, across all 47 counties",
    body: "Nearby listings surface first, from your neighbourhood outward, so what you see is something you can realistically go and collect.",
  },
];

const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "What is the best free marketplace in Kenya?",
    a: "It depends on what you are selling and how you want to reach buyers. Shopi is free to browse and free to post, takes no commission and no listing fees, and combines a local discovery feed with direct buyer-to-seller chat and AI-assisted listings.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a Kenyan marketplace with no commission?",
    a: "Yes. Shopi charges no commission and no listing fees. Because Shopi does not process payments or hold money, the full amount you agree with the buyer goes to you.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is Shopi different from other online marketplaces in Kenya?",
    a: "Three things: discovery happens in a personalized local feed rather than only through search, Shopi Agent creates listings from a photo and finds products from a description, and there is no checkout or commission — buyers and sellers deal directly.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a business to sell on Shopi?",
    a: "No. You do not need a registered business, a website, a bank account or a verified phone number. A phone camera and something to sell is enough.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use Shopi alongside other selling channels?",
    a: "Yes, and many sellers do. A Shopi post can be shared straight to TikTok, and nothing stops you listing the same item in a WhatsApp group or on another platform at the same time.",
