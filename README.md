This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Blog content: SEO checks and freshness

Blog posts live in `lib/blog.ts`. Run the audit before merging content changes, and once a month:

```bash
npm run seo:audit                    # add -- --stale-days=120 to tighten the review window
```

It fails on hard rules: a meta description over 155 characters, `primaryKeyword` missing from the title, lead, body or description, a duplicate title, or a broken `/blog/` link. It warns about posts under ~1500 words, posts with fewer than two internal links, and posts not reviewed in 180 days.

For each post flagged as due for review:

1. Re-check anything that goes out of date: NTSA/TIMS steps, fees, prices, app features and screenshots of the flow.
2. Update or expand the sections that have drifted, and add links to any newer posts or landing pages on the same topic.
3. Set `updatedAt` to the date of the edit. This updates the sitemap `lastmod`, the Article schema `dateModified`, Open Graph `modifiedTime` and the "Updated" date on the page. Don't bump it for typo fixes.
