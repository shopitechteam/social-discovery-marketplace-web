 * into the document and hydrated before the feed is interactive. It is the
 * single biggest lever on the feed's cold-start cost, because every card is a
 * PostCard: ~100 DOM nodes, an IntersectionObserver, a ResizeObserver and a
 * `<video>` element each. At 16 the first document carried ~1,700 elements and
 * ~940 KB of HTML, which delayed LCP-image discovery by seconds. Six keeps the
 * first paint small; `FEED_LOAD_MORE_SIZE` refills ahead of the scroll so the
 * feed still feels endless.
 *
 * NOTE: the server preload in app/[lang]/(main)/feed/page.tsx must request this
 * exact same limit, or the client's query misses the SSR cache and refetches
 * page 1 on hydration.
