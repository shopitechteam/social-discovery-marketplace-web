/**
 * The counties that get their own landing page.

 * Local intent ("… for sale in Nakuru") is the strongest commercial query
 * pattern in this market and siteConfig.keywords already targets it, but the
 * site had no page to rank for any of it. This is deliberately a curated
 * shortlist rather than all 47: a page per county with no inventory behind it
 * is thin content, which costs more than the coverage is worth. Add a county
 * here once it has listings to show.

 * `name` must match the county string the API stores on listings — it is used
 * verbatim as the `county` filter argument.
