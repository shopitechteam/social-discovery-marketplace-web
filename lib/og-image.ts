/**

 * ImageResponse renders through satori, which decodes PNG, JPEG and GIF only —
 * it has no WebP or AVIF decoder, and it draws an undecodable source as an
 * empty box rather than failing loudly.
 *
 * Shopi's image host (images.shopi.co.ke) serves *every* variant as .webp —
 * large.webp, original.webp, thumb.webp — and offers no format parameter, so
 * the original "pick a candidate satori can decode" approach found nothing to
 * pick and every share card fell back to its placeholder. Listings shared to
 * WhatsApp showed a shopping-bag emoji where the product photo should be.
 *
 * So we decode it ourselves: fetch the bytes, re-encode to JPEG with sharp, and
 * hand satori a data URI. Everything is best-effort — any failure returns null
 * and the caller's placeholder stands, because a card with no photo still beats
 * a route that 500s and leaves the share with no image at all.

 * unreliable about fetching link images much above a couple of hundred KB, so
 * the photo fix would have swapped a missing image for a missing preview. JPEG
 * brings the same card back under 150 KB.
 *
 * Falls back to the original PNG response if the re-encode fails, because a
