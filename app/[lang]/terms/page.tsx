            Welcome to Shopi. These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern
            your use of the Shopi platform, operated by Shopi Limited
            (&quot;Shopi&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;). By creating an
            account or using Shopi, you agree to these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please read them carefully. If you don&apos;t agree, please
            don&apos;t use Shopi.
          </p>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="1. What Shopi Is">
          <p>
            Shopi is a social discovery classifieds marketplace. We help buyers
            and sellers in Kenya find each other through content-driven
            listings, search, and direct messaging.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Shopi is not an online store, and we are not a party to
              transactions between users.
            </strong>{" "}
            We do not process payments, hold money, arrange delivery, or take a
            commission on any sale. Any deal, payment, or delivery arrangement
            is made directly between the buyer and seller, entirely outside of
            Shopi. We are not responsible for the outcome of any transaction.
          </p>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="2. Eligibility">
          <p>
            You must be at least 18 years old to create a Shopi account. By
            registering, you confirm that you meet this requirement and that the
            information you provide is accurate.

            By posting Your Content, you grant Shopi a non-exclusive, worldwide,
            royalty-free licence to host, store, display, reproduce, and
            distribute it on the platform, solely for the purpose of operating
            and promoting Shopi (for example, showing your listing in feeds and
            search results). This licence ends when you delete Your Content or
            your account, except for copies retained for legal, safety, or
            backup purposes for a reasonable period.
          </p>

        <LegalSection title="6. AI-Assisted Features">
          <p>
            Shopi may use automated tools — for example, to suggest a category
            for your listing based on its content. These tools are a convenience
            feature and don&apos;t replace your responsibility to describe your
            listing accurately.

            You can block another user or report a conversation directly within

        <LegalSection title="9. Platform Availability">
          <p>
            We work to keep Shopi available and reliable, but we don&apos;t
            guarantee uninterrupted access. We may modify, suspend, or
            discontinue any part of Shopi at any time, including for

        <LegalSection title="10. Suspension and Termination">
          <p>
            We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms,
            our Community Guidelines, or applicable law, or if we reasonably
            believe your account poses a risk to Shopi or other users.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can stop using Shopi and request deletion of your account at any

            To the fullest extent permitted by Kenyan law, Shopi Limited is not
            liable for any loss or damage arising from transactions between
            buyers and sellers (including scams, non-delivery, or disputes over
            item condition), content posted by users, or interruptions, errors,
            or unavailability of the platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nothing in these Terms limits liability that cannot be limited under

            exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Kenya. We encourage you to
            contact us first so we can try to resolve any issue informally.

        <LegalSection title="14. Changes to These Terms">
          <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time as Shopi evolves. If we
            make material changes, we&apos;ll notify you through the app or by
            other reasonable means. Continuing to use Shopi after changes take
            effect means you accept the updated Terms.
