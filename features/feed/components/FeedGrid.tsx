          `useForYouFeed` suspends. Without a boundary here, the *route's*
          boundary was the nearest one, and on the server it could only be
          completed if the feed query resolved during the render. Against the
          production API (~2.4s for one page) it never did, so React abandoned
          the whole boundary and shipped a skeleton, leaving the client to fetch
          and render every card — and leaving the LCP image out of the HTML
          entirely, where no preload or fetchpriority hint could reach it. That
          abort is React error #419.

          Giving the suspending part its own boundary whose fallback is the
          server-fetched first page means the server always has something real
          to render: the cards, and with them the LCP <img>, land in the initial
          HTML. The live feed then takes over on the client with the same items
          (same query, same cache), so the swap is invisible. */}
