 * Scroll restoration alone could not do this. A tab link pointed at the bare
 * route (`/en/explore`), while the screen being returned to was
 * `/en/explore?q=iphone` or the feed's Following sub-tab: the page rebuilt
 * itself from the bare URL, showed different content, and the saved position
 * no longer matched anything on it.
 *
 * Only a tab's root screen is remembered, never a detail opened from it (a
 * chat, a listing), and only for tabs whose screen is fully described by its
 * URL. Profile is left out on purpose: its sections are pushed screens with
 * their own back button, which a tab tap must not land inside.
