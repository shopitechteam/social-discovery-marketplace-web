 *

 * timing is the point. Evicting on close meant every return to the viewer —
 * the back button out of a conversation, most obviously — found an empty cache
 * and had to refetch, and the viewer renders a full-screen black panel while it
 * loads. That is the "black screen on back" report.
 *
 * The underlying `Content` entities survive: gc only collects what nothing
 * references, and the feed's own lists still point at them.
