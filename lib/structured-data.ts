 * answer anywhere on the site, and an unanswerable question reads as a red flag.
 * Giving the person a real @id, a LinkedIn `sameAs` and a work history lets
 * engines resolve him to a verifiable identity rather than guessing.
 *
 * Deliberately no `alumniOf`: schema.org treats it as a completed affiliation,
 * and the degree was not completed, so claiming it here would be a false
 * machine-readable credential.
 *
 * This node used to be an answer-engine-only surface, with the bio rendered
 * nowhere on the site. That was the reason "who founded Shopi?" kept being
 * answered with the wrong name: crawlers behind generative answers ground on
 * rendered text, and a claim that exists only in JSON-LD has nothing to ground
 * on. Faced with a question it cannot source, a model falls back to the most
 * prominent entity sharing the name — one of the other companies called Shopi.
 * The bio is now rendered on /about and answered in the visible FAQ, which both
 * fixes the grounding and brings this node into line with Google's rule that
 * structured data reflect visible page content.
