/**
 * Seller-intent landing pages for cars.
 *
 * Every car page on Shopi so far targets *buyer* intent — "Toyota Premio for
 * sale in Kenya" (see search-intent-pages.ts). That misses the other half of a
 * marketplace: the person who owns a Premio and types "sell my Premio" or "how
 * much is my Premio worth". Those queries have lower volume but far higher
 * commercial value to us, because a seller creates supply, and supply is what
 * makes the buyer pages worth ranking in the first place.
 *
 * Content here is deliberately model-specific — who buys this car in Kenya,
 * what they ask, what moves the price. Generic pages spun per keyword are
 * doorway pages and get filtered; these have to earn the ranking.
 *
 * Deliberately no price figures: a stale or wrong number destroys trust with
 * the exact person we want to convert, and we have live listings that answer
 * the question better than a hardcoded range could.

    buyerProfile:
      "Premio buyers are usually family or first-executive-car buyers who want comfort and low running costs without moving to an SUV. Many are upgrading from a Fielder or an Axio, so they compare your car directly against those, and they care more about condition and paperwork than about mileage alone.",
    priceFactors: [
      "Grade and trim — F, X and G-package cars sit at different prices even in the same year.",

They tend to be less price-sensitive and more specification-sensitive — sunroof, leather, powered tailgate and 4WD all materially change what someone will pay.",
